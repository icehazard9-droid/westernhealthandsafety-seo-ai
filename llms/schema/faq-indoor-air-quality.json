      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Proactive indoor air quality assessments are performed on a regular schedule to prevent issues, while complaint-based testing is triggered by occupant symptoms, odours, or post-damage conditions such as smoke or flooding. Both methods help identify and resolve air quality concerns."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Common indoor contaminants include mould spores, radon gas, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and particulate matter (PM2.5). These vary based on HVAC design, materials, and building use."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "IAQ testing is required in British Columbia under WorkSafeBC OHS Regulation 4.79 when complaints arise, occupancy changes, or ventilation systems are modified. In Alberta, while not explicitly mandated, IAQ assessments are expected during workplace investigations and to comply with general OH&S duties."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Western Health & Safety evaluates ventilation against ASHRAE 62.1 using either the Ventilation Rate Procedure (prescriptive method) or the Indoor Air Quality Procedure (performance-based). These assessments ensure compliance with OH&S and indoor air dilution targets."
